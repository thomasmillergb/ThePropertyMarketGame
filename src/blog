How i am building the app.

Most of my java8 learning comes from winterbe.com has alot of very good blogs.

Created a basic web app using Spring boot with intelliJ. Added all the default decency i needed. Spring Core, Spring MVC, Jackson and so on.

Created a basic web service where i can send a object back as JSON.
Setup a defult api prefix api/v1/ so that if i ever decided that i wanted to improve the app i could start on V2 and
leave all of the V1 api working as before. Its very important no to trash old API for new functionality because
it could break functionality which might depend on the old API. So creating new endpoint is always perfered over
destroying functionality.  It also gives the option to stop all V1 apis if i moved on.

Creating a basic folder structure from a UML plan.

Started to create Interfaces to layout the sekeleton of the program without getting bogged down in detail. Also created
default function in the interfaces which should not change (Big like using a abstract class however its a required imp which
can be overridden)
