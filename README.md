<h1>The Property Market Game</h1>
<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a personal project to gain a deeper understand of Java8 NoSQL and RXJS.</p>

<p>I am currently a developer at RBS stuck using very clunky and old tech which make development incredibly slow and unintuitive. This is to be expected due to the
project being old and it would be to much work to bring into the new world. Let just say its way over bord on unneeded Design pattens. For example creating a interface for every
single Class even if it is only used once.</p>

<p>I am doing to try and use as many libraries as i can and try to use as many features that Java8 can provide.</p>

<h2>The Goal</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is not to create the best app ever but to design an app which can be develop very quickly with the minimal setup. To achive this will
try complete all the tasks below</p>
<ul>
    <li>Have a Fully working web server using spring boot within 15 mins</li>
    <li>Setup a project structure which is manageable but not over complicated to the point where you spend more time plumbing(I hate wasteful plumbing, its the man task of my day job...) then coding.</li>
    <li>Implement the strategy pattern to reduce a huge cluster f*** of a overly complicated object hierarchy</li>
    <li>Use a NoSQL which is JSON orientated to allow semlesss object transfers from the database to the frontend </li>
    <ul>
        <li>I have used mongoDB before so i am going to try out couchDB</li>
        <li>Big data is every where and without NoSQL i am going to be jobless</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The Frontend is going to be deigned using RXJS another future language</li>
    <li>To avoid bad coding and using libraries to avoid repeating boring coding which someone has already done for me</li>
</ul>
<p>The end goal is to host this on a server so any one can play with the project</p>

<p>Use maven command to boot mvn spring-boot:run</p>
<p>mvn package && java -jar target/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar</p>
